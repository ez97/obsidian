A **compiler** generates machinecode through a series of stages, based on the rules of the programming language, the instruction set of the target machine, and the conventions followed by the operating system.

**assembly code** : a textual representation of the machine code giving the individual instructions in the program

As another example, many of the ways programs can be attacked, allowing malware to infest a system, involve nuances of the way programs store their run-time control information

nuance : a very slight difference in appearance, meaning, sound, etc.

Relative to the computations expressed in the C code, **optimizing compilers** can **rearrange** execution order, **eliminate** unneeded computations, **replace** slow operations with faster ones, and even **change** recursive computations into iterative ones.
